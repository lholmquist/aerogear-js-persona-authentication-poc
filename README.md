## Building

### Installing Build Dependencies
To install the dependencies of the project, navigate to the project's root folder and run the following command:

    $ npm install

This will install the versions of the dependencies declared in package.json. This is only required to be done once before building the first time, or if the dependencies in package.json have been updated.

## Start the server
To start the server, execute:

    $ node server.js

## Open the main test page

Open the `http://127.0.0.1:3000/persona-test.html` address on your browser. You might want to open the firebug in Mozilla Firefox in order to see the interaction with the verification server.
